#Code{4}Lib Midwest 2013 recap

![LocalWiki &amp; Library Engagement talk at Code 4 Lib Midwest 2013](/img/c4lmw13.jpg)

<p>Earlier this month I participated in <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Midwest">#c4lmw</a>, an intimate and energetic midwest regional library tech conference.  The workshops were challenging and useful.  Especially <a href="http://jstirnaman.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/installing-fuseki-with-jena-and-tdb-on-os-x/">parsing linked data with a SPARQL server</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">building Jekyll</a>.  Both instances were lead by University of Kansas Medical Center librarian <a href="https://twitter.com/jastirn">Jason Stirnaman</a> and University of Iowa data services librarian <a href="http://shawnaverkamp.com/homepage/">Shawn Averkamp</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about adding a layer of local knowledge to the ecosystem of open structured data via the future of <a href="http://localwiki.org">LocalWiki</a>, and a role that libraries can play.  The slides are up on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zelip/building-networked-local-knowledge-localwiki-library">slideshare</a>, but the dynamic slides powered by <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a> can be found at <a href="http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~bzelip/c4l">people.lis.illinois.edu/~bzelip/c4l</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from learning new tools and networking, what I appreciate most about <a href="http://code4lib.org">Code{4}Lib</a> is how open and accessible the organization is.  Conference websites are malleable wikis, and the bar for involvement is interest.  A major contrast with the annual ALA conference for example.  I walked away from <a href="http://ala13.ala.org/">ALA 2013 in Chicago</a> exhausted and bewildered.  I walked away from #C4LMW with more skills and a sense of empowerment.</p>
