#Hack Library School's #HLSDITL

<p><a href="https://hacklibschool.wordpress.com">Hack Library School</a> is an independent banner that LIS students have been using for networking, mentoring and professional development <a href="http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2010/hacklibschool/">since 2010</a>.  It's an idea that resonates strongly with us, as we are often reflecting, struggling with and learning new tools, and engaging with others.</p>
<p>I've known about <a href="https://twitter.com/hacklibschool">@HackLibSchool</a> for a while now, but it was a tweet to their blog post about #HLSDITL that provoked me to jump in.  Here's the premise:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We would like to invite all library students to participate in round two of Library Student Day in the Life from October 28 – November 1. Our first round in March 2013 was a smashing success with seventy students participating!</p>
  <p>We hope this project, which will revolve around a community of students sharing each day’s experiences for a week, will help prospective students learn what library school is actually like and connect current LIS/IT students with those in other programs. This is a great way to discuss what you’re learning, where you’re working, and all the details that make up your unique library school experience.</p>

<p>What a great idea, I love productive fun.</p>
<p>Plus this highlights the accessibility of Hack Library School, which I identified as a wonderful feature of Code{4}Lib <a href="code4lib-midwest-2013-recap.html">in my recap of their midwest regional meeting</a>.</p>
<p>So now it's just about jumping in.  I've used the #HLSDITL challenge to <a href="new-blog.html">get this blog up and running</a>, something I was planning to do during winter break. During the week I plan on writing about class projects and ideas, modern web stuff, and other bits of of <a href="../about.html#keywords">interest</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to reading and getting to know other <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hlsditl">#HLSDITL</a>ers.</p>
<p>Thanks Hack Library School for being open, encouraging, and cool!</p>
