#New blog

Inspired by [#HLSDITL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HLSDITL), I expedited building this new site to get in the habit of writing and practing the web.

I chose against a WordPress site from dealing with often confusing and bloated markup and style. I've set out for leaner source files, with clean lines and subtle design, based on standards and best practices. There are more details in the about page.

For the time being the site will progress without any automated features on the back end - just editing and creating static files in an environment that looks like a dynamic blog. I think running through these motions in a handi-craft manner will boost my cognitive sense of what can be automated. As I've only recently gotten into anything beyond html and css, I often struggle with the challenges programming brings. This handi-craft method is an experiment in learning, while focusing my online presence.
