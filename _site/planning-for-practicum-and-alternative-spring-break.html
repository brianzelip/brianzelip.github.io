              <p>#Planning for practicum and alternative spring break</p>

<p>Incoming LIS students would do well to start thinking about practicum and alternative spring break (<abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr>) early.  These two internship activities are like ephemeral privileged passes to anywhere you'd like to professionally go.  They can help a wild dream of yours come true, be a great networking opportunity, and provide new experience and insight into familiar areas of work.</p>
<p>The administrative point of contact for all matters practicum and <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> is most likely the staff in your school's professional/career development wing.</p>
<p>While each activity is similar it is useful to understand their differences.  Besides the fact that practicum is usually for school credit and <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> is not, I think the main dynamics at work are:
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li>scope of involvement</li>
        <li>type of host institution</li>
        <li>location of institution</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Whereas <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> takes place during a fixed week, practicum spans a semester or more depending on your school.  Here at <abbr title="Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science">GSLIS</abbr> for example, our practicum can start as soon as we've arranged it with our host institution, then we register for it during the semester we plan to complete it.</p>
<p>Because of this dynamic of time, the scope of involvement is different for each project.  My approach is to use <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> for an introductory overview into an area in which I have little experience and a lot of interest.  I expect the insight gained from <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> to inform future classes and research to develop a stronger skill set in this area.</p>
<p>Practicum provides an opportunity to drill deep.  My plan is to use practicum as a vehicle for specialization in an area where I'm already strong.</p>
<p>This framework of new and familiar orients the remaining questions of which hosts to approach.  Since <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> can be like shooting for the stars, why not go all out and make the sky the limit?  Use this opportunity to go somewhere you've always wanted to go but never got around to or thought was out of reach because of time, location or a lack of skills.  Any lack of skills is probably negotiable in this instance as the host doesn't have to pay you, plus you're working under the legitimacy of your institution.  The time is fixed during spring break (keep in mind the spring break schedule of your identified host, particularly if your aim is to work with a school in any form).  While traveling to a distant host introduces extra expenses, perhaps your school offers funding for such endeavors.  At <abbr title="Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science">GSLIS</abbr> for example, a small stipend of up to $300 is available for <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr>.  Although not much it certainly helps.</p>
<p>Out of necessity practicum takes place where you go to school.  This is a great opportunity to approach the best local examples of work with which you're familiar.</p>
<p>Of course the above constraints are lifted if you work with your host institution virtually.</p>
<p>My particular plan is to use <abbr title="alternative spring break">ASB</abbr> to experience a dream job for which I have subject expertise but that requires a skill set in which I'm weak.  I've got my sites set on Indiana University's <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~aaamc/">Archives of African American Music and Culture</a>, Columbia College's <a href="http://www.colum.edu/CBMR/">Center for Black Music Research</a> and the University of Chicago's <a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/cja/">Chicago Jazz Archive</a>.  As cost is an issue, I've chosen nearby locations where I have contacts that I can room with for free.  I've identified three hosts because I don't expect to get into my first choice and there may be possible spring break schedule conflicts.</p>
<p>My practicum planning is equally exciting.  Where I'm weaker in working with special collections and archives I'm stronger in working with the Web.  I'm fantasizing getting close to cool folks like <a href="http://pixotech.com/">Pixo</a> (who hired a recent <abbr title="Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science">GSLIS</abbr> <a href="http://pixotech.com/profile/cate-kompare/">grad</a>!) and the University Library's <a href="http://dunatis.grainger.uiuc.edu/">Technology Prototyping Service</a>.  With this project I'm hoping to experience the work flow and quality of real web application developers doing great work.</p>
